      <article>
        <h3>My name is Steven Tipton</h3>
        <p>I am from Beattyville, Ky</p>
        <p class="about-me">
          I've wanted to be able to write<br> programs since I was about 14. I never had
          the opportunity until<br> now. I enjoy working with other people as a team in order to
          get <br>a project done. You can't do everything yourself. Having people <br>you can
          rely on makes a world of difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my journey to get to this point, I have had the opportunity to be:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a carpenter</li>
          <li>an electrician</li>
          <li>a painter</li>
          <li>a home maintenance specialist</li>
          <li>a cable groundman</li>
          <li>a jack of all trades and a master of none</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

        <h3>About Steven Tipton</h3>
        <p class="about-me">
          Before I got into web development, I began working in the<br> construction industry after graduating high
          school. I was a carpenter <br>first, but soon they put me as an
          electricians apprentice. I eventually <br>became an electrician and
          remained one until 2016.
        </p>
        <p>I am also:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>an artist</li>
          <li>a musician</li>
          <li>a wood craftsman</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Being a web developer is the next chapter in my journey. I am a
          student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I enjoy
          programming and being able to get to work with others.
